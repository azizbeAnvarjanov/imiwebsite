# 🔄 Infinite Build Loop Fix

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The build was stuck in an infinite loop because of a recursive npm script call:

```
> npm run apphosting:build
> npm run apphosting:build
> npm run apphosting:build
... (infinite loop)
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The issue was in the npm scripts configuration:

**Before (❌ Infinite Loop):**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "apphosting:build": "npm run build" // This calls itself indirectly
  }
}
```

And in `apphosting.yaml`:

```yaml
scripts:
  buildCommand: npm run apphosting:build  // This calls the script above
```

**The Loop:**

1. `apphosting.yaml` calls `npm run apphosting:build`
2. `apphosting:build` script calls `npm run build`
3. But Firebase App Hosting was somehow calling `apphosting:build` again
4. **Infinite loop!**

## ✅ Solution Applied

**After (✅ Fixed):**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "apphosting:build": "next build" // Direct call to next build
  }
}
```

And in `apphosting.yaml`:

```yaml
scripts:
  buildCommand: npm run build  // Use the standard build script
  runCommand: npm start
```

## 📋 Files Updated

1. **`package.json`** - Fixed `apphosting:build` script to call `next build` directly
2. **`apphosting.yaml`** - Changed build command to `npm run build`
3. **`apphosting.staging.yaml`** - Changed build command to `npm run build`

## 🧪 Verification

The build now works correctly:

```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Compiled successfully
# ✓ Linting and checking validity of types
# ✓ Collecting page data
# ✓ Generating static pages (5/5)
# ✓ Collecting build traces
# ✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

## 🎯 Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Eliminates Recursion**: No more circular script calls
2. **Simplifies Build Process**: Uses standard Next.js build command
3. **Reduces Complexity**: Fewer script layers to debug
4. **Standard Practice**: Follows Next.js conventions

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push the changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Resolve infinite build loop in npm scripts"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Firebase App Hosting** - The build should now complete successfully

3. **Monitor the deployment** in Firebase Console

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Avoid Script Recursion**: Never have scripts call each other in a loop
2. **Use Direct Commands**: Call the actual build tool directly when possible
3. **Keep It Simple**: Minimize the number of script layers
4. **Test Locally**: Always test build commands locally before deploying

## 🐛 Prevention

To prevent this in the future:

- Always test npm scripts locally
- Avoid circular dependencies in scripts
- Use direct tool calls when possible
- Keep build configurations simple

**The infinite build loop is now fixed!** 🎉
