    "text-3": "Our story began in 2018, when the Impuls Multi-Specialty Private Clinic was established in the Norin district of the Namangan region. The clinic’s goal was to provide patients with modern, high-quality medical care. However, soon after its opening, the world faced the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, which became a serious challenge for all healthcare systems.",
    "text-4": "During the pandemic, the clinic’s doctors worked tirelessly to help patients, yet limited resources made it impossible to assist everyone in need. The crisis revealed a much deeper issue — a nationwide shortage of qualified medical professionals. This shortage not only affected the Impuls Clinic but was a serious problem across the entire healthcare sector in Uzbekistan.",
    "text-5": "Recognizing this challenge, the founders of Impuls understood that the long-term solution was not only to treat patients, but also to train future doctors — highly skilled, competent, and ethically responsible medical professionals.",
    "text-6": "In 2019, the idea of establishing a medical institute took shape. The founders studied the world’s leading educational systems, exploring the structure of medical education in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Special attention was given to the USMLE system — a globally recognized standard in medical education.",
    "text-7-en": "After thorough research and collaboration with international experts, the team decided to create a modern medical institute aligned with global educational standards.",
