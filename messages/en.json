  "Institut-history": {
    "text-1": "The history of the opening of the Impuls Medical Institute",
    "text-2": "In 2018, the Impuls multi-specialty private clinic was established in the Norin district of the Namangan region. The purpose of founding the clinic was to provide patients with quality and modern medical assistance. However, during the initial period of the clinic's operation, the COVID-19 pandemic began, which was a severe test for the entire world. During the pandemic, although the clinic was able to help many patients, unfortunately, due to a lack of resources, it was not possible to assist everyone.",
    "text-3": "During the pandemic, finding modern technologies, equipment, and medications required significant funds. The biggest problem was the shortage of qualified doctors. The shortage of medical personnel was a major issue not only for our clinic but also across Uzbekistan. In such a situation, we realized that we needed to take a step towards developing the medical field, not just relying on the available specialists.",
    "text-4": "Thus, in 2019, the idea of opening our own medical institute for training qualified personnel in medicine formed. We studied advanced educational systems abroad, including medical education and healthcare systems in European, Asian, and American countries. We analyzed which countries have the highest level of medical education, how the best quality care is provided to patients, and what educational systems they have.",
    "text-5": "As a result of our studies, we decided to open a medical institute that corresponds to the American USMLE system. To achieve this goal, we involved qualified specialists and learned from them.",
    "text-6": "Finally, in 2022, as a result of several years of our efforts, the first and only private medical institute in the Namangan region — Impuls Medical Institute was opened based on license No. 047559 from the State Inspectorate for Quality Control of Education under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Today, our institute is focused on preparing highly qualified specialists in the medical field based on a modern medical education system."
