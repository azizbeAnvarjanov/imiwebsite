## 🚀 How It Works

### Deployment Flow

1. **Push to GitHub** → Triggers workflow
2. **Build Process**:
   - Install dependencies
   - Create `.env.local` from GitHub secrets
   - Build Next.js application
   - Export static files to `out/` directory
3. **Deploy to Firebase**:
   - Deploy static files to Firebase Hosting
   - Upload environment backup to Firebase Storage
4. **Success Notification** → Deployment complete

### Environment Management

- **Production**: Uses secrets with no suffix
- **Staging**: Uses secrets with `_STAGING` suffix
- **Storage**: Environment files stored in Firebase Storage at `/config/`

## 🔑 Required GitHub Secrets

### Production Secrets

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_P_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_M_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
```

### Staging Secrets (Optional)

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID_STAGING
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_STAGING
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_STAGING
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DOMAIN_STAGING
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_P_ID_STAGING
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BUCKET_STAGING
NEXT_PUBLIC_M_SENDER_ID_STAGING
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID_STAGING
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Run setup script**:

   ```bash
   ./setup-firebase.sh
   ```

2. **Initialize Firebase**:

   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   ```

3. **Set GitHub secrets** (see `FIREBASE_DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md`)
